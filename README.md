This file contain the classifiaction model of german_credit_risk which is implemented in python language.

Approach to solve this problem is to find the loan defaulter which was not able to repay.By using the different parameter to identify the loan defaulters.
Basically is this baised on the classification i am using the classifer in this i apply the logistic regression becouse of credit risk is idenfy in terms of Bad risk or Good risk.
And preprocessed the dataset this dataset contain the categorical data so i convert the categorical data into the numeric data
then i apply the logistic regression in this problem and I also apply the SVC(support vector classifier) which gives the less accurate answer then the logistic regression.And I also apply the Random Forests Classifiers  which gives the more accurate answer then the logistic regression and SVC(support vector classifier).
This file contain three model logistic and Random Forests Classifiers as well as SVC.
I hope my solution is right or workable and understandle to you

thank you.
